<h2>whoami</h2>
<p>I'm a software engineer focused on Linux systems engineering, reliability, and fullstack web developments. Most recently, I worked as a Production Engineer on Meta's Reality Labs Capacity & Efficiency team, where I supported large-scale infrastructure and helped turn messy, manual workflows into maintainable systems. Before that, I was a Software Engineer on the Developer Experience team at Datto, building internal tools and automation that improved how engineers ship and operate software.</p>
<p>I like writing code just as much as I like optimizing it, whether that means tightening a hot path, simplifying an architecture, or improving observability so issues are easier to diagnose. Python is my go-to language, and I've also delivered production projects in Go, PHP, and JavaScript. I'm at my best when I'm given a hard problem with real constraints, clear ownership, and the freedom to iterate toward something that's fast, reliable, and pleasant to use.</p>

<h2>what_i_do</h2>
<p>I make messy systems behave. That means automation, reliability, and debugging that doesn't stop at the application boundary—sometimes the root cause is kernel code, sometimes it's a disk having a midlife crisis.</p>
<p>Next, I want to spend less time on CRUD-heavy internal tooling and more time on interesting systems problems: distributed systems, performance, storage, networking, and Linux internals.</p>

<h2>interests</h2>
<p>I like long walks on the beach and testing in production. I think that Go has my favorite concurrency model but python is too beautiful not to write. If I never write a line of javascript again, I'd honestly be fine with that. At least typescript let's me pretend it's a real programming language.</p>
