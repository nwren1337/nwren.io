        <h3><span class="prompt">nwren@meta:~$</span> ./rlpp</h3>
        <p>Reality Labs Product Portal is a capacity planning tool facilitating long range planning and adhoc capacity requesting. I owned and delivered the end-to-end ad-hoc request workflow and shipped a broad set of product improvements. I also led a migration of core data from graph storage to SQL, including the data model and rollout, with a focus on making the system more reliable, auditable, and easier to operate.</p>

        <h3><span class="prompt">nwren@meta:~$</span> ./gpu_efficiency</h3>
        <p>On the GPU efficiency initiative, a multi-pronged effort to reduce Machine Learning Unreliability (MLU) and improve GPU utilization for large-scale LLM training jobs, I helped build end-to-end workflows for a greenfield Best Practice Enforcer system that automatically detects common training anti-patterns and drives corrective action.</p>

        <h3><span class="prompt">nwren@datto:~$</span> ./qapi</h3>
        <p>QAPI is an ephemeral compute orchestration platform enabling engineers to spin up on demand test environments on KVM virtualizations and aws k8s pods. I contributed the VM recreation flow as well as many administration features. I led the project through an infrastructure hardening effort increasing the uptime from 90% to 99% uptime.</p>

        <h3><span class="prompt">nwren@datto:~$</span> ./kglue</h3>
        <p>kGlue is a microservice written in Go that facilitates the deployment of development applications in kubernetes clusters. I led a refactor of this microservice to make it environment agnostic and decouple it from AWS enabling a migration to on-prem k8s clusters to save money and improve start up times.</p>
